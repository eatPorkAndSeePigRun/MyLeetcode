# 337. House Robber III

## Description:

The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called the "root." Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that "all houses in this place forms a binary tree". It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without alerting the police.

## Solution:

```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int rob(TreeNode* root) {
        auto amount = postorder(root);
        return max(amount[0], amount[1]);
    }
    
    vector<int> postorder(TreeNode *root) {
        if (!root)  return {0, 0};
        auto l = postorder(root->left);
        auto r = postorder(root->right);
        return {root->val + l[1] + r[1], max(l[0], l[1]) + max(r[0], r[1])};
    }
};
```
