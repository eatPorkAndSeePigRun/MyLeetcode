# 872. Leaf-Similar Trees

## Description:

Consider all the leaves of a binary tree.  From left to right order, the values of those leaves form a leaf value sequence.

Two binary trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf value sequence is the same.

Return `true` if and only if the two given trees with head nodes `root1` and `root2` are leaf-similar.

## Solution:

```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    bool leafSimilar(TreeNode* root1, TreeNode* root2) {
        vector<int> leaves1;
        vector<int> leaves2;
        dfs(root1, leaves1);
        dfs(root2, leaves2);

        return leaves1 == leaves2;
    }

    void dfs(TreeNode* node, vector<int>& leaves) {
        if (!node)
            return;
        if (!node->left && !node->right)
            leaves.push_back(node->val);
        dfs(node->left, leaves);
        dfs(node->right, leaves);
    }
};
```
