# 406. Queue Reconstruction by Height

## Description:

Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers `(h, k)`, where `h` is the height of the person and `k` is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to `h`. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.

## Solution:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> reconstructQueue(vector<vector<int>>& people) {
        sort(people.begin(), people.end(), 
             [](const vector<int> &a, const vector<int> &b) {
                 return (a[0] > b[0]) || (a[0] == b[0] && a[1] < b[1]);
             });
        
        vector<vector<int> > ans;
        for (const auto &e : people)
            ans.insert(ans.begin() + e[1], e);
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```
