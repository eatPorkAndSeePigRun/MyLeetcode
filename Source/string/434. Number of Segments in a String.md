# 434. Number of Segments in a String

## Description:

Count the number of segments in a string, where a segment is defined to be a contiguous sequence of non-space characters.

Please note that the string does not contain any **non-printable** characters.

## Solution:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int countSegments(string s) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i)
            if ((i == 0 || s[i-1] == ' ') && (s[i] != ' '))
                ++count;
        return count;
    }
};
```
