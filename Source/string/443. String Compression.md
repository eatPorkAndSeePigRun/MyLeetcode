# 443. String Compression

## Description:

Given an array of characters, compress it in-place.

The length after compression must always be smaller than or equal to the original array.

Every element of the array should be a **character** (not int) of length 1.

After you are done **modifying the input array** in-place, return the new length of the array.

## Solution:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int compress(vector<char>& chars) {
        int anchor = 0, write = 0;
        for (int read = 0; read < chars.size(); ++read) 
        {
            if ((read+1 == chars.size()) || (chars[read+1] != chars[read])) 
            {
                chars[write++] = chars[anchor];
                if (read > anchor) 
                    for (char c: to_string(read-anchor+1)) 
                        chars[write++] = c;
                anchor = read + 1;
            }
        }
        return write;
    }
};
```
