# 541. Reverse String II

## Description:

Given a string and an integer k, you need to reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string. If there are less than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and left the other as original.

## Solution:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    string reverseStr(string s, int k) {
        int len = s.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i += 2*k) {
            int j = min(i+k, len);
            reverse(s.begin()+i, s.begin()+j);
        }
        return s;
    }
};
```
