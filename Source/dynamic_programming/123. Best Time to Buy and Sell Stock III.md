public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int buy1 = INT_MIN;
        int buy2 = INT_MIN;
        int profit1 = 0;
        int profit2 = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < prices.size(); ++i) {
            buy1 = max(buy1, -prices[i]);
            profit1 = max(profit1, buy1 + prices[i]);
            buy2 = max(buy2, profit1 - prices[i]);
            profit2 = max(profit2, buy2 + prices[i]);
        }
        return profit2;
    }
};
