# 11. Container With Most Water

## Description:

Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

## Solution:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int maxarea = 0, l = 0, r = height.size() - 1;
        while (l < r) {
            maxarea = max(maxarea, min(height[l], height[r]) * (r - l));
            if (height[l] < height[r])
                ++l;
            else
                --r;
        }
        return maxarea;
    }
};
```
