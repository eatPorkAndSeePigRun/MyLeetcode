# 717. 1-bit and 2-bit Characters

## Description:

We have two special characters. The first character can be represented by one bit `0`. The second character can be represented by two bits (`10` or `11`).

Now given a string represented by several bits. Return whether the last character must be a one-bit character or not. The given string will always end with a zero.

## Solution:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isOneBitCharacter(vector<int>& bits) {
        int i = 0, len = bits.size();
        while (i < len - 1)
            i += (bits[i] + 1);

        return i == len - 1;
    }
};
```
