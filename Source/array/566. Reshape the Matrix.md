# 566. Reshape the Matrix

## Description:

In MATLAB, there is a very useful function called 'reshape', which can reshape a matrix into a new one with different size but keep its original data.

You're given a matrix represented by a two-dimensional array, and two **positive** integers **r** and **c** representing the **row** number and **column** number of the wanted reshaped matrix, respectively.

The reshaped matrix need to be filled with all the elements of the original matrix in the same **row-traversing** order as they were.

If the 'reshape' operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix.

## Solution:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> matrixReshape(vector<vector<int>>& nums, int r, int c) {
        int old_rows = nums.size(), old_cols = nums[0].size();
        if (nums.empty() || (r*c != old_rows * old_cols))
            return nums;
        
        vector<vector<int> > res(r, vector<int>(c));
        
        int rows = 0, cols = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < old_rows; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < old_cols; ++j) {
                res[rows][cols] = nums[i][j];
                ++cols;
                if (cols == c) {
                    ++rows;
                    cols = 0;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return res;
    }
};
```
