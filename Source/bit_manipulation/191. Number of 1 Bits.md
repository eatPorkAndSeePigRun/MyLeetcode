# 191. Number of 1 Bits

## Description:

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and return the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

## Solution:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
        int res = 0;
        while (n != 0) {
            ++res;
            n &= (n - 1);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
