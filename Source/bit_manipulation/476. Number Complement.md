# 476. Number Complement

## Description:

Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

## Solution:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int findComplement(int num) {
        int i = 1;
        while (num > i) {
            i = i << 1;
            i = i | 1;
        }
        return num ^ i;
    }
};
```
