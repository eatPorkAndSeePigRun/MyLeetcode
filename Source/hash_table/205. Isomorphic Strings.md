# 205. Isomorphic Strings

## Description:

Given two strings `s` and `t`, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

## Solution:

```c++
class Solution {
 public:
  bool isIsomorphic(string s, string t) {
      unordered_map<char, int> m1, m2;
      for (size_t i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i)
      {
          if (m1[s[i]] != m2[t[i]])
              return false;
          else
              m1[s[i]] = m2[t[i]] = i + 1;
      }
      return true;
  }
};
```

remark：

- 迭代每个字符，若相同则保存下标加一，若不同返回false
