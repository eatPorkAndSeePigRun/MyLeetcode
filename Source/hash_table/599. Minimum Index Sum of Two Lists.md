# 599. Minimum Index Sum of Two Lists

## Description:

Suppose Andy and Doris want to choose a restaurant for dinner, and they both have a list of favorite restaurants represented by strings.

You need to help them find out their `common interest` with the `least list index sum`. If there is a choice tie between answers, output all of them with no order requirement. You could assume there always exists an answer.

## Solution:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> findRestaurant(vector<string>& list1, vector<string>& list2) {
        unordered_map<string, int> m;
        int len1 = list1.size();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < len1; ++i)
            m[list1[i]] = i;
        
        vector<string> res;
        int min_sum = 0xffff, len2 = list2.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < len2; ++i) {
            if (m.find(list2[i]) != m.end()) {
                int cur_sum = i + m[list2[i]];
                if (cur_sum < min_sum) {
                    res.clear();
                    res.push_back(list2[i]);
                    min_sum = cur_sum;
                } else if (cur_sum == min_sum)
                    res.push_back(list2[i]);
            }
        }
        
		return res;
    }
};
```
