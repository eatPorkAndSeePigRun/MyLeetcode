# 409. Longest Palindrome

## Description:

Given a string which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, find the length of the longest palindromes that can be built with those letters.

This is case sensitive, for example `"Aa"` is not considered a palindrome here.

## Solution:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int longestPalindrome(string s) {
        vector<int> count(128, 0);
        for (auto &c : s)
            ++count[c];
        
        int res = 0, odd = 0;
        for (auto &n : count) {
            res += (n & ~1);
            odd |= (n & 1);
        }
        
        return res+odd;
    }
};
```
