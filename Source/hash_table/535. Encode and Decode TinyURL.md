# 535. Encode and Decode TinyURL

## Description:

- Note: This is a companion problem to the System Design problem: Design TinyURL.

TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as `https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl` and it returns a short URL such as `http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk`.

Design the `encode` and `decode` methods for the TinyURL service. There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be decoded to the original URL.

## Solution:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int count = 0;
    unordered_map<int, string> m;

    // Encodes a URL to a shortened URL.
    string encode(string longUrl) {
        m[++count] = longUrl;
        return to_string(count);
    }

    // Decodes a shortened URL to its original URL.
    string decode(string shortUrl) {
        return m[stoi(shortUrl)];
    }
};

// Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
// Solution solution;
// solution.decode(solution.encode(url));
```
