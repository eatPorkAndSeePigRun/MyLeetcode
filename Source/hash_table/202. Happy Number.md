# 202. Happy Number

## Description:

Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

## Solution:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isHappy(int n) {
        unordered_set<int> s;
        
        while (n != 1) {
            if (s.find(n) != s.end())
                return false;
            
            s.insert(n);
            int temp = 0;
            while (n != 0) {
                temp += (n%10)*(n%10);
                n /= 10;
            }
            n = temp;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

remark：

- 一旦不可能出现1时，则一定会进入无限循环当中，此时求的和也一定是循环出现的。所以用set判断是否出现过
