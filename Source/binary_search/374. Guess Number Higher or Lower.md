# 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower

## Description:

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from **1** to **n**. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.

You call a pre-defined API `guess(int num)` which returns 3 possible results (`-1`, `1`, or `0`):

```markdown
-1 : My number is lower
 1 : My number is higher
 0 : Congrats! You got it!
```

## Solution:

```c++
// Forward declaration of guess API.
// @param num, your guess
// @return -1 if my number is lower, 1 if my number is higher, otherwise return 0
int guess(int num);

class Solution {
public:
    int guessNumber(int n) {
        int low = 1, high = n;
        
        while (low < high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            
            int res = guess(mid);
            if (res == 0)
                return mid;
            else if (res < 0)
                high = mid - 1;
            else
                low = mid + 1;
        }
        
        return low;
    }
};
```
